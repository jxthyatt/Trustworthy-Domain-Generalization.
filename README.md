# Trustworthy-Domain-Generalization (TruDG)
Official repository for the submitted paper “Both Multi-silo and Multi-modality Matter: Trustworthy Domain Generalization via Personalized Federated Learning and Language-driven Zero-shot Adaptation”. Previous version of Code is [here](https://github.com/jxthyatt/Trustworthy-Domain-Generalization). :rainbow: Final Code will be released after acceptance.

## Replicate Demo and Results
### Federated DG under Distribution Heterogeneity ( :herb::herb: TABLE I)
:rocket::rocket: We evaluate client **personalization** under distribution heterogeneity in federated scenario “from Photo-Art-Cartoon to  Sketch”. ( :star: here model is performed on [PACS](https://datasets.activeloop.ai/docs/ml/datasets/pacs-dataset/) dataset). Please view more details in TABLE I.
